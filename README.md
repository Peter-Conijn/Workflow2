# Workflow2
Part 2/2 of the loosely coupled app example.
This project was inspired by the blog 'Red and Bundle', by Ren√© Brummel.
That particular post can be found here: https://redandbundle.com/2018/12/25/interface-extensions-with-workflows/

This project can work together with Workflow1 and the aforementioned blog post to demonstrate how you can use the BC Workflow functionality to create loosely coupled apps that can communicate with each other without the need for dependencies.
